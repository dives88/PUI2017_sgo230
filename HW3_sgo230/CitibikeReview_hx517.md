Idea:
Younger people are more likely to ride Citi Bikes late at night

Null hypothesis:
The proportion of riders 35+ to total riders for trips starting at midnight-5 am is higher or equal to the trips starting at 5 am - midnight.

H0:
old riders in night/all riders in night >= old riders in day/old riders in day

Ha:
old riders in night/all riders in night >= old riders in day/old riders in day

Alpha: 5%
Confidence level: 95%

I think it's an interesting idea to measure the age of riders at night and the age of cycling riders during the day. And I think you extracted the necessary data to test for significance. 

In the part of the hypothesis you wrote, I believe it is a typo, and you want to express the following hypothesis:

H0:
old riders in night/all riders in night >= old riders in day/all riders in day

Ha:
old riders in night/all riders in night >= old riders in day/all riders in day

If that's the case, I do not think your steps is done because you have not showed the proportion of riders over 35 years old in all riders.

In addition, there is no confidence level step. The reason for this is that it is not divided into every day, so it is equivalent to only one sample, that is, the ratio of the total 35+ riders to total all riders at night, divided by the ratio of the total 35+ riders to total all ridersat day, in whole month.

if Only cosidering the proportion of the comparison, the hourly ride ratio is unnecessary. For confidence level, it can use each day as a sample.
I would recommend rephrasing the hypotheses as follows:

Null hypothesis: 

The proportion of riders 35+ to total riders for trips starting at midnight-5 am is higher or equal to the trips starting at 5 am - midnight everyday.

H0:
old riders in night/all riders in night >= old riders in day/all riders in day

Ha:
old riders in night/all riders in night >= old riders in day/all riders in day

To test this, I believe you simply need to calculate the ratio of rides that fall in both categories. You have already counted the number of each type,  and plot it in 24 hours, you can do the same thing to each day data, and calculate the portion by each day.Thus, when you have the data of the proportion of 35 + riders to all riders in night/day per day, you can test it, and got the significant level.
