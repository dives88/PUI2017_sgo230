Worked solo on Assignment 1 (as required)<br>
Used the repository of Chun-Chieh Tsai (cct367@nyu.edu; https://github.com/DishT)<br>
Link to my analysis: https://github.com/sgo230/PUI2017_cct367/blob/master/HW3_cct367/CibibikeReview_sgo230.md (also merged with his repo)
<br><br>

Worked solo on Assignment 2 to gather summary tables for various studies (see table below)<br><br>

Worked solo on Assignment 3. GitHub is having trouble displaying the .ipynb file, but it is correctly viewable in this generic Notebook viewer tool: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sgo230/PUI2017_sgo230/blob/master/HW4_sgo230/Assignment%203.ipynb. <br>
Please see my note about the sidedness of the test - went against Federica's skeleton notebook example and my best intuition in constructing the hypothesis tests in order to replicate the paper's results.<br><br>

Worked primarily solo on Assignment 4. Helped Davey with portions of the lat/long -> borough conversion. Offered other general assistance on that part to a few other CUSP students (not specific code but advice/guidelines). Same issue as above - notebook not rendering in GitHub. Viewable here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sgo230/PUI2017_sgo230/blob/master/HW4_sgo230/Assignment%204.ipynb.

# FBB ANCOVA: the IV is not test or not test, but the rhGH vs rosiglitazone + rhGH, or all studies would have the same IV. 
# multiple regression:  what is this simbol <>? do you mean == ? 

# otherwise ok
